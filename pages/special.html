        <h1>Special Mechanics</h1>
        
        <h2>Squares</h2>
         <p>There are 4 types of squares. Landing on a square will trigger its effect.</p>
        
        <h3>Blank Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a blank or empty white/yellow square. Landing on this square does nothing.</p>
        
        <h3>Q & A Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a square with a blue question mark. Players who landed on this square will be given a question to answer.</p>
        <img src="GFX Examples/qa_square.png" alt="An image of a yellow Q & A square." width = "50" height = "50">
        <h3>Spin Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a symbol on the square. Players landing on this square will have to spin the 'Cyclo Wheel'</p>
       <img src="GFX Examples/spin_square.png" alt="An image of a yellow cyclo spin square." width = "50" height = "50">       
        <h3>Wall/Blocked Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a red X on a gray square. When moving, if this square is in the way, the square will block the players movement.</p>
        <p>Players cannot land or pass through this square.</p>
        
        <h3>Start Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a green square with a house on it. All palyers start on this square.</p>        
        <img src="GFX Examples/start_square.png" alt="An image of the start square." width = "50" height = "50">
        
        <h3>Gain/Lose Elctron Square</h3>
        <p>Indicated by a + or - sign next to a number with the colors green/red respectively. </p>
        <p>If the player lands on a Gain Square (+) They will gain the amount of electrons and add it to their orbitals.</p>
        <p>If the player lands on a Lose Square (-) They will lose the amount of electrons and subtract it from their orbitals.</p>
    
        
        <h1>Electrons and Orbitals</h1>
        <p>Each player will have boxes where they can place their electrons.</p>
        <p>Each box can only contain 2 electrons.</p>

        
        <h1>Q & A</h1>
        <p>Landing on a Q & A square will force to palyer to answer a question in Science 9 Quater 2.</p>
        <p>There are 3 levels of questions indicated by its color:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red - Difficult Question - 6 Electrons</li>
          <li>Yellow - Intermediate Question - 4 Electrons</li>
          <li>Green - Easy Question - 2 Electrons</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If a player answers a question correctly, the will gain the amount of electrons indicated.</p>
        <p>If a player answers incorrectly, they will return back to the square they came from.</p>
      </div>
    <h1>Cyclo Spin</h1>
      <p>If a player lands on a 'Cyclo Spin' square they will have to spin the 'Cyclo Wheel'.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lose All - The player will lose all the electrons in their orbital.</li>
        <li>+20 - The player will gain an additional 20 electrons to their orbital.</li>
      </ul>
